## Overview
Through the classic Snake game with the "cheese mode" variation, we train snake agents to become "experts" at collecting fruit while going against other snake agents. This unique game variation places empty sections in every other segment of all snakes, allowing snakes to circle through themselves. In terms of the agent competition, snake agents not only want to maximize their score, but also take out other snake agents.
